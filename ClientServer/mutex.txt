Mutex usage in the server code:

1. pthread_mutex_t clients_mutex: This is a mutex variable that is used to synchronize access to the clients array. It is initialized using pthread_mutex_init() before the server enters the main loop.

2. pthread_mutex_lock(&clients_mutex): This call locks the mutex before accessing the clients array. It ensures that only one thread can hold the mutex at a time, preventing concurrent access to the clients array by multiple threads.

3. clients[client_count++] = client_socket;: This statement adds a client socket to the clients array. Since it is protected by the mutex, it ensures that multiple threads do not modify the clients array simultaneously, avoiding potential race conditions.

4. pthread_mutex_unlock(&clients_mutex): This call unlocks the mutex after accessing the clients array, allowing other threads to acquire the mutex and access the array.

The use of mutexes in this code ensures that concurrent threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the shared clients array, preventing data corruption and ensuring thread-safe access to shared resources.
